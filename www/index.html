<table width=700><tr><td>
<p>Do you stash an extra house key under a rock or a potted plant, or leave a copy with a trusted neighbor "just in case"?  Do you keep extra copies of important documents in a bank safe deposit box?</p><br>

<p>KeyEscrow.net is a digital equivalent of that concept, originally designed for <a href=https://launchpad.net/ecryptfs>eCryptfs</a> users who choose to encrypt their private data using a strong, randomly generated key.</p><br>

<p>Users of <a href=https://www.ubuntu.com>Ubuntu</a>'s Encrypted Home Directory are prompted on first boot to record their long, random mount passkey.  These users <i>should</i> print it out, write it down, and store the hard copy in a safe, secure physical location.  Some of these users may choose to deposit a copy of their <code>~/.ecryptfs/</code> configuration and random mount passphrase here at <a href="/">KeyEscrow.net</a>, "just in case", so that they can digitally <a href=/retrieve>retrieve</a> it later if necessary.  On a command line, just run the command:</p><br>
<center><big><big><b><code>ecryptfs-escrow-private</code></b></big></big></center>
