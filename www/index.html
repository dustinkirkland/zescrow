<p align=center><b>Welcome to Gazzang zEscrow</b></p><br/>

<p>Gazzang zEscrow is a free service for Ubuntu Desktop users who choose to encrypt their home directories.  zEscrow enables a user to deposit a copy of their <code>~/.ecryptfs/</code> configuration and random mount passphrase and digitally retrieve it later, if lost or forgotten.</p>

<p>The service is simple to use!  Just install the <a href="apt:zescrow-client">zescrow-client</a> package on your Ubuntu system and run the <a href="http://manpg.es/zEscrow">zescrow</a> command.  You will be guided through the process and then back here to the zEscrow login.  You can recover your data by retrieving your backup from zEscrow, and then using the <a href="http://manpg.es/ecryptfs-recover-private">ecryptfs-recover-private</a> tool.</p>

<br/><br/><p>Gazzang offers a family of data encryption, key management, and operational monitoring products for cloud computing.  Visit <a href="http://www.gazzang.com">gazzang.com</a> for more information.
