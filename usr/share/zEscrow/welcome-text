# Some eCryptfs users choose to store a backup of of their eCryptfs
# configuration and their randomly generated MOUNT passphrase on an
# escrow server for retrieval later, as it will be REQUIRED if you
# ever need to recover your encrypted data.
#
# You will be prompted for:
#  - a key escrow server
#  - your LOGIN passphrase (which is NOT sent to the server!)
#
# Your LOGIN passphrase will be used to decrypt your MOUNT passphrase
# and create an archive of your ~/.ecryptfs/ configuration and your
# MOUNT passphrase.  It will be encrypted with a public key unique to
# your chosen open source key escrow server compatible with
# zEscrow.
#
# After a successful upload, you MUST click on the generated URL and
# login using a Google OpenID account, and associate your account
# with this upload.  Access to that account will be  REQUIRED to
# securely retrieve your escrowed data later!
