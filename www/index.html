<p align=center><big><big><b>Welcome to Gazzang zEscrow<sup>TM</sup></b></big></big></p><br/>

<p>Gazzang zEscrow<sup>TM</sup> is a free service for Ubuntu Desktop users who choose to encrypt their home directories.  zEscrow<sup>TM</sup> enables a user to deposit a copy of their <code>~/.ecryptfs/</code> configuration and random mount passphrase and digitally retrieve it later, if lost or forgotten.</p><br>

<p>The service is simple to use!  Just install the <a href="apt:zescrow-client">zescrow-client</a> package on your Ubuntu system and run the <a href="http://manpg.es/zEscrow">zescrow</a> command.  You will be guided through the process and then back here to the zEscrow<sup>TM</sup> login.  You can recover your data by retrieving your backup from zEscrow<sup>TM</sup>, and then using the <a href="http://manpg.es/ecryptfs-recover-private">ecryptfs-recover-private</a> tool.</p><br>

<p>Gazzang offers a family of data encryption, key management, and operational monitoring products for cloud computing.  Visit <a href="http://www.gazzang.com">gazzang.com</a> for more information.</p><br>
