<p>Do you stash an extra house key under a rock or a potted plant, "just in case"?  Do you keep extra copies of important documents in a bank safe deposit box?</p><br>

<p>KeyEscrow.net is sort of a digital equivalent of that concept, originally designed for <a href=http://launchpad.net/ecryptfs>eCryptfs</a> users who choose to encrypt their private data using a strong, randomly generated key.</p><br>

<p>Users of <a href=http://www.ubuntu.com>Ubuntu</a>'s Encrypted Home Directory are prompted on first boot to record their long, random mount passkey.  These users <i>should</i> print it out, write it down, and store the hard copy in a safe, secure physical location.  These users may additionally choose to stash an extra copy of their <code>~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase</code> file here at KeyEscrow.net, "just in case".</p><br>
